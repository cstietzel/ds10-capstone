<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>This application will present a list of probable completions to an English phrase that you enter.  The prediction algorithm is based on a 3-gram Kneser-Ney model that was produced using just over 2.5 million excerpts of English text from News, Blog, and Twitter entries.</p>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>Use the text box to type or cut-and-paste the phrase you would like to complete. After each space is entered, GuessWord will produce the five most likely completions based on the language model.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>A table with the five most likely completions based on their Kneser-Ney probability.  The word along with it's associated probability is given.  When there is no phrase entered, or if the trigram or bigram models cannot be used, the prediction is based on the five most likely words based on unigram maximum likelihood probability. </p>
